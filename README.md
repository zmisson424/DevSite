# Dev Site

## Website Design

#### Name Coming soon

My personal website to be used for both jobs and resume purposes. It will be a
fully functional project\created with react. Everything will be hosted through
Firebase. The website should be well designed and maintained. Clients should
use this website as a point of reference for what they will get when working
with me.

### Home Page

This should be a short simple documentation of what I can do. It will have
a focus with small business and local startups to get them off the ground
QUICK. Key words are speed, accessibility, good communication skills.

### Projects

A whole page dedicated to past works. This is also where I will host my
Ohio State class portfolio (Temporary home).

what I can do for your project.

Stackoverflow, and upwork.

## Code Information

### Build

The project is built using React from Facebook https://github.com/facebook/react
It is a javascript driven language base on Node.js.
Each element is somewhat component base using Storybook
https://github.com/storybooks/storybook
Storybook is a little unnecissary for this size of a project but it becomes a
great practice tool and also allows clean code to show off for clients and
other collaboration projects.
Lastly, it is run and built using yarn https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn

### Layout

Everything will be controlled and maintained within the SRC file. From there,
there will be four sub directories. Components will store global components to
be used between pages. Pages will store the build for each webpage. Firebase
will host any backend Firebase functionalities.

### Firebase

This website is not doing anything crazy that really needs Firebase operation.
It is just fun to play with and helps with Hosting and Image storage. Also,
Google Analytics will be built in.
